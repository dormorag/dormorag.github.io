<p style="text-align: justify;">I use causal analysis in conjecture with machine learning to study decision-making and labor markets. My academic research explores the impact of narratives and memory on evaluations and performance, text analysis of job ad features, and household consumption patterns. Much of my work involves industry applications, in which I develop data-driven solutions for business and sports-related questions, such as designing sales agents' incentives and MLB draft strategy.</p>
