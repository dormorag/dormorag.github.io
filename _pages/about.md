I'm a PhD candidate at The University of Pittsburgh majoring in Behavioral and Labor Economics.

I use causal analysis in conjecture with machine learning to study decision-making and labor markets. Specifically, my ongoing research projects explore narratives' influence on valuations, job ad features' effects on viewers and applicants pool, and determinants of performance evaluation. 

Much of my work involves collaborations with industry (e.g., Arrive Logistics, Phenom People, Pittsburgh Pirates, and the NBA), in which I answer business problems with data-driven research.
