  <blockquote> While the significance of narrative thinking has been increasingly recognized by social scientists, very little empirical research has documented its consequences for economically significant outcomes. The current paper addresses this gap in one important domain: valuations. In three experiments, participants were given the opportunity to sell an item they owned (mug in Study 1, hat in studies 2 and 3) using an incentive-compatible procedure (multiple price list). Prior to making selling decisions, participants were randomly assigned to either a narrative treatment, in which they were asked to tell the story of their item, or a list treatment, in which they were asked to list the characteristics of their item. The narrative treatment led to significantly higher selling prices and increased rates of participants refusing all offered prices. We further explore potential mechanisms, and the impact of different types of narratives, by analyzing self-reported classifications of, and employing natural language processing techniques on, participants' narratives.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote>
    This paper investigates how individuals infer their abilities from past experiences and subsequently make occupation choices. Through a randomized experiment involving easy or hard real-effort practice tasks, situational factors (task averages) were manipulated, and future performance predictions along with task preferences were elicited. The results reveal that participants, even in full-information settings, often attributed the influence of external factors to personal abilities, leading to distorted performance expectations and inefficient occupational choices. Forty percent of the average treatment effect of practice difficulty on occupational choice is explained by performance beliefs, while the residual effect is attributable to perceived intrinsic enjoyment. Although the hard practice treatment led to significantly lower expected performance and enjoyment, it also led to improved test performance. Finally, implications for poverty traps, skill assessment programs, and practice design are discussed.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote>
    Utilizing machine learning and product-level data describing single men's and women's consumption patterns, we create an index that quantifies the ``gendered'' nature of consumer goods. Our index reveals substantial gender disparities in spending behavior across many products and consumption categories, which we validate through a series of sensitivity analyses. We use the index to investigate the impact of gender-specific shocks to spouses' economic stature on the budget allocation within heterosexual married households toward products predominantly favored by either gender. Specifically, our findings indicate that the adoption of robots, which heightened women's economic standing relative to men, led to a noticeable shift in consumption patterns, favoring products more frequently bought by single women. Conversely, the expansion of fracking, which bolstered the demand for young, less-skilled men, resulted in an increased consumption of products predominantly preferred by men. We then extend our analysis to children's products. While neither of the shocks affected the expenditure allocated to children's products, positive shocks to the economic stature of women led to an increase in expenditure on products prevalently bought for daughters (rather than sons).
